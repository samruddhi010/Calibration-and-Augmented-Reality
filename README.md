#Project 4:Calibration and Augmented Reality :
This project is about learning how to calibrate a camera and then use the calibration to generate virtual objects in a scene. The end result should be a program that can detect a target and then place a virtual object in the scene relative to the target that moves and orients itself correctly given motion of the camera or target.
